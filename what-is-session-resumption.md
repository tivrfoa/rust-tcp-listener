## Asking ChatGPT: what is session ressumpition?

**Session resumption** is a feature in TLS (Transport Layer Security) that allows a client and server to resume a previously established secure session without repeating the entire TLS handshake process. This reduces the computational overhead, saves time, and improves performance, especially in environments where many secure connections are established frequently.

There are two main methods for session resumption:

### 1. **Session ID (ID-based session resumption)**:
   In this method, when a client and server complete the initial TLS handshake, the server assigns a unique session ID to the connection. The session ID is stored by both the client and the server.

   - **How it works**:
     1. **Initial handshake**: After a successful TLS handshake, the server generates a unique session ID and sends it to the client along with the encryption keys.
     2. **Session storage**: Both the client and server store this session ID along with the session-specific encryption keys and other session data (e.g., cipher suites used).
     3. **Resuming the session**: When the client reconnects to the same server, it includes the previously received session ID in the handshake message.
     4. **Server lookup**: The server checks whether it still has the session data associated with that session ID.
         - If it finds the session data, the server skips the full handshake and resumes the session by restoring the stored keys and parameters.
         - If the session data has expired or is no longer available, the server initiates a new full handshake.
   
   - **Advantages**:
     - Reduces computational overhead, as fewer round trips and cryptographic operations are needed for session resumption.
     - Avoids the need for generating new session keys, improving performance.

   - **Drawbacks**:
     - The server has to maintain a session cache, which can be challenging in distributed systems where there are multiple servers (e.g., load-balanced environments).

### 2. **Session Tickets (Ticket-based session resumption)**:
   This method removes the need for the server to store session information. Instead, the session information is packaged into an encrypted ticket by the server and sent to the client. The client presents this ticket during future connections to resume the session.

   - **How it works**:
     1. **Initial handshake**: After the first TLS handshake, the server generates and encrypts the session state (keys, cipher suites, etc.) into a session ticket and sends it to the client.
     2. **Client stores the session ticket**: The client keeps this ticket locally.
     3. **Resuming the session**: When the client reconnects to the server, it includes the session ticket in its handshake message.
     4. **Server decrypts the ticket**: The server decrypts the session ticket and, if valid, resumes the session with the stored session information.
         - The server does not need to store any session data, as it relies on the client providing the session ticket.
   
   - **Advantages**:
     - Eliminates the need for server-side session caches, making it ideal for environments with multiple servers (e.g., distributed or load-balanced environments).
     - Provides better scalability compared to session ID-based resumption.
   
   - **Drawbacks**:
     - The ticket needs to be securely encrypted, and the server must ensure it has the necessary cryptographic keys to decrypt it.
     - If the server's encryption keys are compromised, session tickets could be decrypted, potentially exposing session data.

### Why Use Session Resumption?
- **Performance Boost**: Re-establishing a secure connection with a full TLS handshake involves several steps (including expensive cryptographic operations such as key exchanges). Session resumption reduces this overhead by reusing the existing session’s encryption keys, cutting down the number of round trips required.
- **Reduced Latency**: In scenarios where many short-lived connections are common (e.g., in web browsers), session resumption significantly decreases the time it takes to establish secure connections by avoiding the full handshake process.
- **Mobile and IoT Devices**: Session resumption is particularly beneficial for devices with limited processing power, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, because it reduces the computational burden of performing full handshakes repeatedly.

### How Resumption Fits into the TLS Handshake Process

- **Without Resumption (Full Handshake)**:
  1. Client and server exchange `ClientHello` and `ServerHello` messages.
  2. Server sends its digital certificate.
  3. Key exchange is performed (e.g., via Diffie-Hellman).
  4. Both sides generate session keys.
  5. The connection is established.

- **With Resumption**:
  1. Client sends `ClientHello` with a session ID or ticket.
  2. If the server accepts the resumption, it skips key exchange and certificate verification.
  3. Both sides restore the session and start encrypted communication immediately.

This reduces the number of handshake steps and minimizes latency, which is particularly important for protocols like HTTPS, where many connections to the same server can happen in a short period of time.

### Security Considerations
While session resumption improves performance, it also introduces some security challenges:
- **Forward Secrecy**: Both session ID and session ticket-based resumption reuse previous session keys. This can reduce forward secrecy if the same keys are used for too long. Forward secrecy ensures that even if a server’s long-term private key is compromised, previous sessions cannot be decrypted.
   - To mitigate this, session resumption is usually time-limited (i.e., tickets and session IDs expire after a certain period).

- **Session Hijacking**: If an attacker can intercept or steal session tickets or IDs, they might be able to impersonate a client. This risk can be reduced with proper encryption and secure management of session tickets by the server.

### Summary:
- **Session resumption** allows clients and servers to reuse existing session information (session ID or session tickets) to avoid performing the full TLS handshake, reducing overhead and improving performance.
- It is commonly used to speed up connections in HTTPS and other secure protocols, particularly for repeated short connections.
- **Session IDs** store session information on the server, whereas **session tickets** offload storage to the client, making the latter more scalable for distributed systems.
